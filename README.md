# Free Legal Help — Prototype

## What this is
A minimal prototype of your Free Legal Help search site. Features:
- Flask backend (serves API + static frontend)
- SQLite database with seeded laws & plain-language summaries
- AI-powered search: uses OpenAI embeddings if `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set, otherwise falls back to TF-IDF semantic search
- Simple frontend (HTML/JS) with search box and language selector (English/Hindi/Marathi placeholders)
- Admin page to add laws (password-protected)

## Quick start (local)
1. Create a Python virtualenv and activate it.
2. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Seed DB: `python seed_db.py`
4. Run: `python app.py`
5. Open `http://localhost:5000`

## Railway deployment
- This app is ready to be deployed on Railway. Add environment variables if you want:
  - `ADMIN_PASSWORD` (default: adminpass)
  - `OPENAI_API_KEY` (optional — if set, OpenAI embeddings will be used for better semantic search)
- Railway will detect `python` and run `python app.py`.

## Admin login
- Email: {"admin@yourdomain" if True else ""}
- Username: admin
- Default password: admin123 (change immediately)
